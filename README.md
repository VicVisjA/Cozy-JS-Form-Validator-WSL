# Cozy-JS-Form-Validator-WSL

A minimalist, "cozy" web application designed to demonstrate the complete lifecycle of data—from a polished user interface to a persistent SQL database. This project was developed within the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) environment, bridging the gap between front-end aesthetics and back-end reliability

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

DOM Manipulation: Handling form submission events and toggling UI states (Success Toasts).

SQL Integration: Writing efficient queries to insert and retrieve data.

Full-Stack Flow: Connecting a modern UI to a database via an API layer.

Linux Workflow: Managing local development servers and databases within a WSL terminal.
